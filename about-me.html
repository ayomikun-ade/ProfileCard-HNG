        <p>
          I'll just try to keep this short. I'm a front-end developer (still
          allegedly) that loves building stuff. Been into the whole tech thing
          for a while and finally found my footing here. Definitely still going
          to explore more but I'm here for now ao enjoy it while it lasts.

          All these things so far are still allegedly cause I feel like I still
          have a lot to learn (cause I do). But you know what they say about
          practice making perfect right? So I'll just keep on pushing till I get
          there.
